# Overview and Index

The UW [eScience Reproducibility and Open Science Working
Group](http://escience.washington.edu/about-us/working-groups/reproducibility-and-open-science/)
meets regularly and hosts [seminars](presentations.html)
to discuss the issues and practices around tools
and practices to enhance data sharing, preservation, provenance,
and reproducibility.  We are collaborating with
[working groups at NYU and Berkeley](https://reproduciblescience.org/),
also funded by the Moore/Sloan [Data Science Environment](http://msdse.org/)
project.

We consider better instrumentation of tools
in support of sharing and reproducibility, the design of repositories
for collecting reproducible experiments, techniques to query and
analyze shared data and workflows to facilitate re-use.  Open science
is closely related to reproducibility, sharing needs in both
technological and software advances as well as in changes to the
research culture.  However, reproducible research need not be
completely open and there are cases where it will not be due to
privacy issues, proprietary data, or reluctance on the part of
scientists to share software that has taken years to develop or
data that was hard to acquire.  

Reproducibility starts at the level
of individual scientists or groups of collaborators being able to
reproduce and build upon their own work, as well as to later verify
its correctness if necessary.  Open science is a vision to work
towards broader sharing that typically requires and facilitates
reproducibility.
