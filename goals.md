# Goals and Benefits

The primary goals motivating these [guidelines](guidelines.html) are:

 - To achieve greater scientific validity and integrity by making it easier to
   verify published results.

 - To increase productivity of current and future researchers on funded
   projects.

 - To increase the impact of the research performed, software developed, and
   papers published.

 - To help promote data and code as first class research products.

 - To increase access to and usability of research products by other
   researchers.

 - To facilitate the more rapid adoption of ground-breaking research (which normally
   requires greater scrutiny).

 - To use the DSE as a test bed for developing and promoting tools and cultural
   changes across a broad spectrum of academic disciplines.

The last goal is an important aspect of the DSE project and so feedback
regarding difficulties in following these guidelines, or suggestions for
improving them, are always welcome. These guidelines are expected to evolve
over the next several years to better meet these goals.

Since the overarching goals are greater productivity, increased impact, and
better science, it is hoped that researchers will find these guidelines
useful to follow in all their work, and will view them as valuable in
achieving their own research goals (rather than as an onerous requirement
for this particular funding source).

It is also hoped that other research groups and labs around campus and
beyond will find it valuable to adopt similar guidelines. Feedback,
suggestions, and reports of success or failure are encouraged from any
source.
