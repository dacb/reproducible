We are interested in clarifying guidelines for steps that researchers at UW and
elsewhere can take to increase the reproducibility and openess of their work. We
are currently collecting individual reports from individuals, organizing and
collecting the kinds of things that they are doing to make their work more
reproducible.

Here are a few exemplars:

- [Steven Roberts](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/web/ROS-profile.md)
- [Randy Leveque](https://gist.github.com/rjleveque/66ca8ffee989d59a8e48347f938b6c15)
- [Ariel Rokem](http://arokem.org/reproducibility/index.html)


Please add a link to your own individual reproducibility report to this list!
